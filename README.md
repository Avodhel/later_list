# What is that thing?
### **Later List** is a simple program to make your own lists for movies, series and books.

# Ok, why would I even need that?
### Sometimes you see a movie, serie or book and think like "Dude I totally need to watch/read that but I don't have time for now." but later you totally forget it. With later list you don't, because you already added it to your list.   

# Why did you even develop that? 
### I don't know for personal need I think. I know there are a lot of fancy websites already to do seperately this but I don't know any for each movie, serie and book. If even there is, well  no regrets  I learned a lot of think.
